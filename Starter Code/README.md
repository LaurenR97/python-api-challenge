#WeatherPy

An Api key was used to pull a list of cities and geo coordinates which was pulled at random using latitude and longitude coordinates to create scatter plots. These plots displayed different variables against the latitude such as cloudiness, max temperature, humidity and wind speed across the cities.
Equations were used to calculate the line regression for each plot which helped to show the correlation between each of the these variables across the cities. 
The results showed graphs for both nothern and southern hemispheres which showed positive, negative as well as no correlations across cities.

#VacayPy

The Geoapify_key was used to pull geographic data across the cities using the city data frame. Data was pulled to narrow down cities based off ideal weather conditions based off different variables. The API was also used to find hotels located within 10,000 meters of the coordinates. Maps were also created based off this data.
